# Diplomacy-AI
We're building an AI to play the board game Diplomacy!

## tl;dr

[Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game))'s a fun game; there's an [annual competition for bots](http://mmi.tudelft.nl/negotiation/tournament); using RL to play the 'gunboat' variant should be relatively easy, but involves coalitions; full Diplomacy also involves natural language processing, so will be a real challenge.

## Introduction

For more details about Diplomacy and bots playing it, see [these slides](http://wrongdoing.org/181004_Diplomacy_AI.pdf), based on [this lightning talk](https://youtu.be/Ojpn3UXZuGM?t=1033) at [Bornhack](https://bornhack.dk) 2018.

## Goals

1. a **winning entry in the annual Automated Negotiating Agents' Competition (ANAC) Diplomacy League**.  Entrants submit negotiating agents that play by being paired to the [D-Brane](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-017-0919-y) module, which picks moves.  See hhe [2019 call for participation](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/bandana/files/call_for_participation_2019.pdf) (deadline 20 May); negotiations use the [BANDANA framework](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/bandana), which has well-defined semantics.
1. an **article in an internationally recognised AI journal** describing our work.  (The ANAC competition has been held as part of the [ICJAI](https://www.ijcai.org), International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.)
1. **beat human players** in online Diplomacy fora such as [PlayDiplomacy](https://www.playdiplomacy.com/) or [Backstabbr](https://www.backstabbr.com).

### de Jonge, Baarslag, Aydo&#287;an, Jonker, Fujita and Ito (2018), "[The Challenge of Negotiation in the Game of Diplomacy](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/homepage/files/articles/The%20Challenge%20of%20Negotiation%20in%20Diplomacy.pdf)", The 6th International Conference on Agreement Technologies 2018, Bergen, Norway.

The best introduction to negotiating agents in Diplomacy.  This article contains a brief overview of Diplomacy, the BANDANA environment, leading entries in 2017, 2018 ANAC Diplomacy Challenges and the challenges facing negotiating agents.  None of the entries so far seem to engage in learning, much less reinforcement learning.

> none of the negotiation algorithms ... have been able to significantly improve the performance over a non-negotiating baseline agent

> Now that modern Chess and Go computers are already far superior to any human player [15](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961), we expect that Diplomacy will start to draw more attention as the next big challenge for computer science.

> we are not expecting the Diplomacy Challenge to have a winner any time soon. We regard it as a long term challenge which might take several years to tackle.

> the success of a negotiating agent may sometimes depend more on the accuracy and efficiency in which it calculates utility values than on the bargaining strategy it applies

> Machine Learning Currently most bots learn very little during the course of play. If a bot can be designed that interprets and learns from the actions of its opponents a better bot may be created.
