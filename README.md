# Diplomacy-AI
We're building an AI to play the board game Diplomacy!

## tl;dr

[Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game))'s a fun game; there's an [annual competition for bots](http://mmi.tudelft.nl/negotiation/tournament); using RL to play the 'gunboat' variant should be relatively easy, but involves coalitions; full Diplomacy also involves natural language processing, so will be a real challenge.

## Basics

For more details about Diplomacy and bots playing it, see [these slides](http://wrongdoing.org/181004_Diplomacy_AI.pdf), based on [this lightning talk](https://youtu.be/Ojpn3UXZuGM?t=1033) at [Bornhack](https://bornhack.dk) 2018.

We intend to develop this project via the [London Reinforcement Learning](https://www.meetup.com/London-Reinforcement-Learning/) Meetup.

## Goals

1. an **AI that systematically out-performs [D-Brane](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-017-0919-y) in Gunboat Diplomacy** (without negotiation).
1. a **winning entry in the annual Automated Negotiating Agents' Competition (ANAC) Diplomacy League**.  Entrants submit negotiating agents that play by being coupled to [D-Brane](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-017-0919-y), which picks moves.  See the [2019 call for participation](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/bandana/files/call_for_participation_2019.pdf) (deadline 20 May); negotiations use the [BANDANA framework](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/bandana), which has well-defined semantics.
1. an **article in an internationally recognised AI journal** describing our work.  (The ANAC competition has been held as part of the [IJCAI](https://www.ijcai.org), International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.)
1. **beat human players** in online Diplomacy fora such as [PlayDiplomacy](https://www.playdiplomacy.com/) or [Backstabbr](https://www.backstabbr.com).  Initially, Gunboat Diplomacy, then full Diplomacy.

The best introduction to negotiating agents in Diplomacy.  This article contains a brief overview of Diplomacy, the BANDANA environment, leading entries in 2017, 2018 ANAC Diplomacy Challenges and the challenges facing negotiating agents.  None of the entries so far seem to engage in learning, much less reinforcement learning.

> none of the negotiation algorithms ... have been able to significantly improve the performance over a non-negotiating baseline agent

> Now that modern Chess and Go computers are already far superior to any human player [[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961)], we expect that Diplomacy will start to draw more attention as the next big challenge for computer science.

> we are not expecting the Diplomacy Challenge to have a winner any time soon. We regard it as a long term challenge which might take several years to tackle.

> Machine Learning Currently most bots learn very little during the course of play. If a bot can be designed that interprets and learns from the actions of its opponents a better bot may be created.

> I had pulled off a particularly vicious stab (not even a very good one, as it turned out) on an ally who had served me faithfully for five game years. I waited, cringing, for the next development; and there in the next post was a letter with the familiar postmark. I opened it apprehensively.

> 'Dear Richard,' it began. 'Ouch! That hurt. It looks as if I shall be playing a rather minor role in our partnership from now on. ...' And it went on to discuss some tactical possibilities for the coming season. Now, this letter had two effects: first, it made me feel like a louse; second, it induced me to let him off the hook, because I knew that in the last resort I would rather get a letter from him than from any of the other potential allies in that area. That is the way to treat a stab.
