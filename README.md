# Diplomacy-AI
we're building an AI to play the board game Diplomacy!

## tl;dr

[Diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game))'s a fun game; there's an [annual competition for bots](http://mmi.tudelft.nl/negotiation/tournament); using RL to play the 'gunboat' variant should be relatively easy, but involves coalitions; full Diplomacy also involves natural language processing, so will be a real challenge.

## Introduction

For more details about Diplomacy and bots playing it, see [these slides](http://wrongdoing.org/181004_Diplomacy_AI.pdf), based on [this lightning talk](https://youtu.be/Ojpn3UXZuGM?t=1033) at [Bornhack](https://bornhack.dk) 2018.

## Goals

1. a **winning entry in the annual Automated Negotiating Agents' Competition (ANAC) Diplomacy League**.  The [2019 call for participation](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/bandana/files/call_for_participation_2019.pdf) (deadline 20 May) wants an agent that only negotiates using the [BANDANA framework](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~davedejonge/bandana); this will be paired with the D-Brane module, which will pick moves.
1. an **article in an internationally recognised AI journal** describing our work.  (The ANAC competition has been held as part of the [ICJAI](https://www.ijcai.org), International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.)
1. **beat human players** in online Diplomacy fora such as [PlayDiplomacy](https://www.playdiplomacy.com/) or [Backstabbr](https://www.backstabbr.com).
